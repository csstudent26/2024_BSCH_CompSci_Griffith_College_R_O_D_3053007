**Project Overview:**

This project consists of a series of class exercises, totaling eight in number. Additionally, it includes the development of a game aimed at demonstrating proficiency in building within the Unity Game Engine.

**Game Description:**

The game, designed as the final exercise, features a player and an enemy. The player's objective is to navigate through four sanctuary areas, collecting valuable treasures for the temple, the largest structure in the construction.

**Challenges Faced:**

Navigation posed a significant challenge due to the failure of the Nav Mesh Surface. Consequently, reliance on conventional navigation scripts became necessary. Although the NavMeshSurface failed to bake the surface entirely, it managed to cover smaller areas by volume. Despite these setbacks, I successfully incorporated a significant portion of the material covered during the course.

**Conclusion:**

The game showcases the utilization of various concepts covered throughout the course, albeit not always meeting the highest standards.
