'no wait: ' This Project consists of a Number of Class Exercises. Eight To be exact. In addition, it also consists of a Game I attempted to Build. The Game's main Aim was to be a Platform for Demonstrating a Knowledge of Building in the Unity Game Engine. The Last Exercise was The Game. In my case, the Game consisted of a 'Player' and an Enemy. The Goal of the Player was to reach 4 Sanctuary Areas and collect valuable Treasures For the Temple (The Largest Building in my Construction). Due to the Failure of Nav Mesh Surface, the Navigation was a major problem, and I had to rely on the conventional script for Navigation. The NavMeshSurface could not bake the Surface, although it did bake some smaller areas (by Volume). Still, I managed to employ a lot of the Material we Learned. There is in the Game the utilization of most of the areas we covered, even if it often Lacks the High Standard.
